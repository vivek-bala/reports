Notes for BMS paper meeting (VB, SJ)

* Create a mapping between Adaptation Loop and science drivers
* Does the formalism of Adaptation Loop provide the vocabulary to define the 
modes of adaptivity? 
* Is this formalism complete?
* Current Motivation to be Challenges in a separate section. 
* Think about the abstractions to describe the adaptivity in applications 
    * possibly derived from the formalism
    * these abstractions could be instantiated with any workflow/runtime system
    * this description to be between adaptation loop and ensemble toolkit
* Describe adaptivity overhead with operators and operations.
