## Updates

### BMS Paper

* Status
    * In progress
        * Work on section 5 (application adaptivity)
            * Collapsed 'understanding adaptivity' and 'computational motivation'
            sections into 'application adaptivity' with multiple subsections
        * Work on section 7 (experiments)
            * Proposed new experiments of characterization of adaptivity overhead.
            Add pseudoplots and description (subsection 7.2).
    * Pending
        * Related work (section 3) - Not able to find many frameworks that support
          application adaptivity. Currently the prevalent method seems to be to 
          manually perform it via scripts or Copernicus in the case of MSM. Want
          to go through [this](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language/wiki/Existing-Workflow-systems) list.
        * EnTK (section 6) - Description of API exposed to user and which 
          component performs which operation of the adaptation loop.
    * Closed

* Deadline: March 28 (SC'18)
